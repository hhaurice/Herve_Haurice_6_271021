# Piiquante #

In order to make this project works:

Make sure everything is installed first on your machine in backend and frontend directory. 
Pre requisites and installation instructions are provided in README file in each directory. 

# Usage #

Open two terminals:
    Create a terminal, go to backend directory and then rename terminal backend and run npm start
    Open another terminal,  go to frontend directory and then rename terminal frontend and run npm start. 
    This should launch your browser automatically. 

# Precaution #

As Nodemon plugin is not installed and didn't work on this project, any change that are made locally on the server are not updated automatically. 
If any changes are made, make sure to relaunch the server in the backend terminal to make the application work. 
Another option would be to install nodemon on your machine in backend directory.
