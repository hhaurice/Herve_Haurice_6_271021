# Piiquante #

This project was created by an already made frontend project provided by Openclassroom. I had in charge to create the backend server to make the application work. The purpose of the application is to create a community where users can share their favorite spicy sauce. Users can like or dislike the sauce added by other users. 
They can either sign in or log in if they are already a Piiquante user. They can create their favorite sauce and post it to the app, modify it or delete it as long as they are owner of the sauce. 

In order to make this project work:

Make sure everything is installed first on your machine in backend and frontend directory. 
Pre requisites and installation instructions are provided in README files in each directory. 

## Usage ##

Clone repository and open two terminals:
In the 1st terminal, go to backend directory `cd backend`, rename terminal backend and `run npm start`.
Open another terminal,  go to frontend directory `cd frontend`, rename terminal frontend and `run npm start`. 
This should launch your browser automatically. 

Once the application is launched, create a profile by entering an email address. Password needs to be at least with 8 characters, with at least a symbol, a number and caps. 

### Precaution ###

As Nodemon plugin is not installed and didn't work on this project, any modification that are made locally on the server are not updated automatically. 
If any changes are made, make sure to relaunch the server in the backend terminal to make the application work. Another option would be to install nodemon on your machine in backend directory.
